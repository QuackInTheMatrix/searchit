# search-it
Did you ever wish you could use a search function on a webpage without opening the page? Well this little python doodle hopes to help you with that.
It can be used by passing the website address(youtube.com for example) and what you wish to search for to the python program. 
The form looks like this: python search-it.py [website] [search]
After it makes a search on a desired webpage it can also memorize it with an easier to use name of your choosing. For example instead of typing duckduckgo.com you could just type duck which makes it easier and quicker to use.
It can also be used with the provided bash script in the terminal with the command browse. It uses the same form as the python program so it should be intuitive to use.
